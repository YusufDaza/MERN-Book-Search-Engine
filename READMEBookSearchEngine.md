### Why did you build this project? 
- I built this project to address the need for a centralized platform where users can easily search for books, save their favorites, and access them from anywhere, solving the problem of scattered book lists and making the reading experience more organized.

### What problem does it solve?
- This project solves the problem of organizing and accessing saved books in one place, making it easier for users to keep track of their reading interests and recommendations. It also streamlines the book search process by integrating with Google Books API.

### What did you learn?
- Through this project, I learned about integrating APIs, implementing user authentication and authorization, managing user sessions, designing user interfaces with modal pop-ups for login/signup, handling user input validation, creating interactive buttons for book management, and implementing responsive design for a seamless user experience.
